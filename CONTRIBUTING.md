# Contribution Guide

## 1. Create the branch locally and publish it

```shell
$ git checkout -b BRANCH-NAME
$ git push -u origin BRANCH-NAME
```

## 2. Make the necessary code changes and commits

### 2.1 Code

When writing code, the developer must ensure that its quality is optimal, so the project's formatting rules, linting,
and good practices for writing clean, modern code must be adhered to.
> ðŸ’¡ Although the project has several layers where code quality is automatically checked, as well as specific npm
> commands that can be executed manually, it is recommended to install extensions in the editor (_ESLint_ and _Prettier_)
> as they allow the code to be adapted as it is written.

### 2.2 Commits

```shell
$ git commit -m "<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]"
```
